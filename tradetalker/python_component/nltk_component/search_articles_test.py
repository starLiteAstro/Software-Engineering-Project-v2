article1 = """Google is racing to fix its new AI-powered tool for creating pictures, after claims it was over-correcting against the risk of being racist.
Users said the firm's Gemini bot supplied images depicting a variety of genders and ethnicities even when doing so was historically inaccurate.
For example, a prompt seeking images of America's founding fathers turned up women and people of colour.
The company said its tool was "missing the mark".
"Gemini's AI image generation does generate a wide range of people. And that's generally a good thing because people around the world use it. But it's missing the mark here," said Jack Krawczyk, senior director for Gemini Experiences.
"We're working to improve these kinds of depictions immediately," he added.
It is not the first time AI has stumbled over real-world questions about diversity.
For example, Google infamously had to apologise almost a decade ago after its photos app labelled a photo of a black couple as "gorillas".
Rival AI firm, OpenAI was also accused of perpetuating harmful stereotypes, after users found its Dall-E image generator responded to queries for chief executive, for example, with results dominated by pictures of white men.
Google, which is under pressure to prove it is not falling behind in AI developments, released its latest version of Gemini last week.
The bot creates pictures in response to written queries.
It quickly drew critics, who accused the company of training the bot to be laughably woke.
"It's embarrassingly hard to get Google Gemini to acknowledge that white people exist," computer scientist Debarghya Das wrote.
"Come on," Frank J Fleming, an author and humorist who writes for outlets including the right-wing PJ Media, in response to the results he received asking for an image of a Viking.
The claims picked up speed in right-wing circles in the US, where many big tech platforms are already facing backlash for alleged liberal bias.
Mr Krawczyk said the company took representation and bias seriously and wanted its results to reflect its global user base.
"Historical contexts have more nuance to them and we will further tune to accommodate that," he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, where users were sharing the dubious results they had received.
"This is part of the alignment process - iteration on feedback. Thank you and keep it coming!"

Microsoft is accelerating a push away from its own Xbox hardware, hoping to boost growth by selling more games on rival consoles as the industry reckons with a protracted slowdown.
The technology group plans to make a handful of games that were previously offered only on its Xbox available on Sony’s PlayStation and Nintendo’s Switch, in a departure from its previous strategy of keeping games developed in-house as exclusives for its own platforms.

Four months after closing its $75bn Activision Blizzard deal, Microsoft also said the first title from the portfolio of the Call of Duty creator would start appearing on its Game Pass subscription service next month.

Phil Spencer, chief executive of Microsoft Gaming, insisted the moves were “not a change to our fundamental exclusives strategy” but reflected a desire to expand the audience for certain games that have hit a ceiling on its own platforms.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Spencer said there was “some diminishing return” from focusing only on selling more games to its existing audience of Xbox owners.

“When I look forward, for our business, finding more players in more places, many of them on the devices that they already own, is a good thing for our own growth as well,” he said.

Content delivers higher margins than hardware for Microsoft, Spencer said, adding: “Extending the software and services and games to more endpoints improves the overall profitability of the [Xbox] division.”

The latest Xbox console generation, first released in 2020, has struggled to keep up with the PlayStation 5 and Switch. Some analysts estimate PS5 outsold Xbox by almost three to one last year, but both have been comprehensively outsold by the older Switch over its lifetime.

“We have more Xbox players off of Xbox consoles than on Xbox consoles today,” Spencer said, referring to those who play its games on PCs or other devices via cloud streaming. “Those lines will continue to diverge. That’s a good thing for the health of the business because the hardware we sell is not a profit driver for us in our organisation.”

Sony announced in December that PS5 hit a milestone of 50mn sales, but the Japanese group nevertheless this week downgraded 2024 forecasts for its gaming unit, as a new wave of lay-offs hit games developers across the industry in the first weeks of the year.

Enders Analysis estimates global gaming revenue rose by less than 1 per cent last year to $184bn, a slower rate than inflation. Enders’ researchers said in a recent report that 2024 was set to be a “bumpy and uncomfortable year across the industry” as “revenue growth is likely to be flat for the next 12-24 months”.

Microsoft is among those cutting jobs, saying last month it would lay off around 1,900 staff, or about 8 per cent of its gaming workforce, including some at Activision Blizzard.

Microsoft has for several years pushed its subscription service, Game Pass, which is available on Xbox and PC but not on PlayStation. About 34mn people subscribe to Game Pass, which costs $17 a month for full access to the latest games on consoles and PC, or less for access to a limited catalogue and multiplayer features.

About 17 years ago, Steve Jobs took the stage at a San Francisco convention center and said he was introducing three products: an iPod, a phone and an internet browser.

“These are not three separate devices,” he said. “This is one device, and we are calling it iPhone.”

At $500, the first iPhone was relatively expensive, but I was eager to dump my mediocre Motorola flip phone and splurge. There were flaws — including sluggish cellular internet speeds. But the iPhone delivered on its promises.

Over the last week, I’ve had a very different experience with a new first-generation product from Apple: the Vision Pro, a virtual reality headset that resembles a pair of ski goggles. The $3,500 wearable computer, which was released Friday, uses cameras so you can see the outside world while juggling apps and videos.

Apple calls it a “spatial computer” that blends together the physical and digital worlds for people to work, watch movies and play games.

Apple declined to provide an early review unit to The New York Times, so I bought a Vision Pro on Friday. (It costs much more than $3,500 with the add-ons that many people will want, including a $200 carrying case, $180 AirPods and $150 prescription lens inserts.) After using the headset for about five days, I’m unconvinced that people will get much value from it.

The device feels less polished than past first-generation Apple products I’ve used. It’s not better for doing work than a computer, and the games I’ve tried so far aren’t fun, which makes it difficult to recommend. An important feature — the ability to place video calls with a humanlike digital avatar that resembles the wearer — terrified children during a family FaceTime call.
